# Understanding_typescript_course


**This course was completely updated, reflects the latest version of TypeScript and incorporated tons of student feedback.**

---

Most People know TypeScript from Angular 2+. It's the Language you have to use there, right?

**It's more than that!**

Learn what TypeScript is, why it really is a **powerful Addition to JavaScript**, what its Features are and how to use it! And whilst doing so, also **understand what you're actually doing in your Angular 2+ Code.**

This Course takes you from the **very Basics** and its most **important Feature** (Types!) to the Point where you're able to **use TypeScript in any of your Projects. ReactJS** Projects included!

As TypeScript is developed by **Microsoft** and strongly advertised used by **Angular 2+ (Google)**, it's **here to stay**.

**Gain an Edge today and be amongst the First to really understand TypeScript!**

### **A Journey into the Future**

As TypeScript code can be compiled to ES5, you'll be amazed by the many **next-gen Features** you can start using Today. Be it ES6 Features like Destructuring or Arrow Functions, Decorators, Generics and Interfaces or Modules - TypeScript has them all!

In this Course, **we'll not stop after the Basics**. You will learn about more **advanced Features** and also how to set up **Workflows with  TypeScript**. This includes a TypeScript-only Workflow as well as a **Webpack Workflow**.

You'll also learn that you're **not limited to Angular 2+** or plain JavaScript/ TypeScript Projects. A complete Module covers how to **use TypeScript with ReactJS** to benefit from its Features, there, too.

### **Practice what you Learn**

Watching Videos is a great Way to Learn. And to a lot of Students, it's the best Way. If you also want to practice the Things you learn, this Course offers you Exercises (and Solutions) in many of the Course Modules.
